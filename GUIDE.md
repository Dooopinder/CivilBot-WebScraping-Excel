# Guide for Multiple Bots

If you want to run multiple instances of the bot, you can do so by creating copies of the bot script file (`bot.py`) and modifying the necessary values.

Here are the steps:

1. Copy the `bot.py` file and rename it to something unique (e.g., `bot2.py`, `bot3.py`, etc.). You can do this in your file explorer or using a command in your terminal or command prompt.

2. Open the new bot script file in a text editor.

3. Modify the necessary values in the script. This could be the login credentials, the specific tasks the bot performs, or any other values that need to be unique for each bot.

4. Save the changes and close the file.

5. Repeat these steps for as many bots as you want to run.

Remember, each bot will run independently of the others, so make sure your system has enough resources to handle all the bots you want to run.

Also, be aware that running too many bots at once may be against the terms of service of the website you're interacting with. Always use bots responsibly and respect the rules and guidelines of the website.
